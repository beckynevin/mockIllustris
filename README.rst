(The brightness of these galaxies is still off, the background level is at 10^-22 or so and these galaxies seem very bright for galaxies at z=2).

This repo creates mock images from SKIRT SEDs of TNG50.
This will contain separate codes for HST and JWST and will eventually contain more general code to do either.
