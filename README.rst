Real Life Illustris TNG50

(The brightness of these galaxies is still off, the background level is at 10^-22 or so and these galaxies seem very bright for galaxies at z=2).

This repo creates mock images from SKIRT SEDs of TNG50.
This will contain separate codes for HST and JWST and will eventually contain more general code to do either.

Identifying Mergers in Illustris
=========

Another goal of this repo is to learn how to work with the online Illustris API in order to identify mergers.
